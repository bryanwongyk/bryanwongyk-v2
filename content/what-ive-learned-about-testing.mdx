I remember trying to learn how, when and where to test code earlier on

https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html

Test pyramid



Test as documentation

Test increase confidence
if there was as bug, there should be a test that no longer

- Use parameterized tests, test all enums



Depth of testing is so important
- Retries, idempotency
- All possible unhappy cases
- Deliberately trying to break the API

Contract testing
Formatting
