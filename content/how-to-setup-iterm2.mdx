Here's a quick post on the current terminal setup I've been using for the past 3 years to help a beginner out. This is my
essential setup to get stuff done.

## Terminal
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) which is a replacement of the stock terminal that comes in macOS. It has [more features](https://iterm2.com/features.html)
than the stock terminal like `hotkey window` which allows you to hit a hotkey to bring iTerm2 to the foreground when you're in another application.

I personally don't take full advantage of the additional features but still prefer iTerm2 more because of how it looks.

## Oh My Zsh
Z shell (or `zsh`) is a command line shell built on top of `bash` and is the default used in macOS. In layman's terms, it's the
actual command line program the terminal is using to execute your commands.

I use the `Oh My Zsh` framework which allows you to install plugins and themes to improve your terminal even more.
Here are the main plugins I use which you can use to help you get started.

### Plugins
#### zsh-syntax
[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) highlights syntax which makes it more readable.

#### z
[z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) lets you jump to your most visited directories.

I use this __all__ the time. For example, say I open up iTerm2 and want to navigate to the path
`~/Library/Documents/Coding/my-project`.

Instead of manually navigating there with the command [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)#:~:text=The%20cd%20command%20can%20be,move%20to%20any%20given%20directory.), I can simply type in
```z my-project``` to take me there.

#### zsh-history-substring-search
[zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search) allows you to type in any part of any command you've written in the past and it'll provide these past
commands as suggestions which you can cycle through using the UP and DOWN arrows.

#### zsh-autosuggestions
[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) provides auto-completion of a command you're typing based on what you've written in the past. Pairing this with
`zsh-history-substring-search` makes it a breeze to repeat commands.

### Themes
I use [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) because I saw it recommended a lot. I really like the customisability
it provides during setup.

However, the colour scheme isn't the most exciting so that could be a dealbreaker for you (even though I find it satisfactory).
