I'm writing this post the day after returning to Sydney from a two-week vacation in Hawaii and Las Vegas.

I don't believe in waiting till the new year to do anything, but I really wanted to do this as:
1. A great way to re-visit and consolidate my personal highlights and lowlights of the year
2. A fun post to read back on in the future (hopefully when my future self has more of life figured out!)
3. A springboard to establish my north star for 2024

## What went well
- **Moved out from Melbourne to Sydney.** I never thought I would do anything like this in a million years.
I love where I lived and grew up in Melbourne. But half-way through the year I decided I
wanted to take the chance to move closer to my girlfriend and to resolve the quarter-life crisis I was undergoing from feeling the
monotony in my day-to-day routine. It definitely wasn't a coincidence that I made this decision during Melbourne's grey, cold and sun-less winter.
Moving to Sydney was objectively an impulsive and financially irresponsible decision but so far it's a life experience I don't regret.
- **Fitness.** I've been lifting for over 5 years now but there were a few major upgrades I made in the last few months of 2023 that led to visible improvements:
    1. Adding stretching as an essential part of my day to counter the effects of sitting all the time.
    2. Finally changing up my lifting routine from the [Reddit PPL routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) to Jeff Nippard's ["Smartest Push Pull Legs Routine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVek72z3F1U). I was stagnating from doing the same routine for so many years. This new routine is a lot more fun because it has more variety and helped kick my body out of what it was used to.
    3. Being more consistent in the last few months. There were a few factors aiding this. Firstly, with a new routine it was addicting seeing progress on *new* exercises. Secondly, moving out meant I became more conscious of how I spent my money which instilled more motivation towards making my gym membership 'worth it'.
- **Chased new experiences.** I tried (and failed) building hobby businesses, went to music festivals/orchestras, tried axe-throwing for the first time, went to the hot springs, tried new restaurants, tried a new sport (pickleball), went on a rare family trip, and started 2024 in a country I'd never been to (USA). I still feel there's room for more improvement here but overall I'm satisfied.
- **Got better as a software engineer.** Over the course of 2023 I've started to become more autonomous leading and completing projects at work. I've also started to pick up being proactive in accumulating knowledge in my downtime again (which you'll see me document in my blog). I find joy and comfort feeling like I'm growing on an upward trajectory and want to make sure I continue to improve my consistency and active management of this.
- **Got a better understanding of my fashion style.** This is a strange and vain one to include but fashion is something I've appreciated and had an interest in for a long time. I feel like I've begun to hone in on the clothes and styles that make me feel good. For the most part, I found myself moving on from 'street-wear' and being drawn to more timeless and 'mature' clothing.

## What didn't go so well
- **Burned out by over-committing to side-projects.** I mentioned attempting to build these hobby businesses as a highlight, but the way they ended were lowlights which taught me to be more ruthless in prioritising my *current* time and energy.
    - Earlier in the year, I tried to launch a TikTok account to tell stories about Australian software businesses with someone I wanted to work with for a long time. After editing our first two videos I realised that video as a medium would eat up more of my time than I expected and I had to muster up the courage to tell my partner that this project wasn't something I could see myself committing to long-term.
    - Later in the year, I built a pickleball website that was averaging 800+ users a week and trending upwards. It was loads of fun, I got to meet really cool people and I got to exercise my brain on web design, performance and SEO.
However, the major bottleneck on me as the main developer, the increasing complexity of the project and my waning passion for it resulted in
unnecessary pressure building up on my limited spare time and energy. It didn't make sense for me to continue working on this anymore. Again, it was another challenging experience confiding in my partners that I needed to step away from it.
- **Neglected friendships.** I've become acutely aware of how challenging it is to actively maintain adult friendships especially after moving to a new state.
It doesn't help that I'm the type of person who likes to be present in the moment (rather than being distracted by social media or messaging), enjoys my alone time, and doesn't have many 'group' hobbies anymore (e.g. team sports or online gaming which satisfied this for me in the past but I don't do anymore).
I think I need to put in a more concentrated effort on this moving forward.

## My goals for 2024
The categories below are inspired by [Sam Parr's Four F's](https://www.theantimba.com/2023-end-of-year-review-finance-fitness-family-fun/) with a few of my own additional categories.

I've deliberately not broken these down into 'SMART' goals. Some of them are phrased as actionable goals with obvious systems (e.g. using my calendar) whereas others are just life philosophies I want to emphasise moving forward.

Just the act of thinking through these and writing them down is enough therapy for me right now.

- **Fitness**: Continue scheduling to go to the gym consistently 5 times a week and stretching everyday.
It's fun to feel like I'm taking care of my body in a way an athlete might (even though I'm far from it!).
Seeing better consistency in the gym lead to more progress also continues to remind me to apply this same level of discipline to other parts of my life.
- **Friends & Family**:
    - **Add to my calendar a reminder to catch up with a friend every one or two weeks**. It sounds silly that I even need to note this down but I'm highly prone to getting swept along by daily life.
    - **Capture more memories by taking more photos.** This is something I wish I did more of. I also feel there's value in posting semi-regularly about what I'm up to on Instagram so that my long-distance family and friends can still feel connected to what I'm up to. I posted very little on social media in 2023.
- **Fun**:
    - **Continue the trend of going on at least two trips every year.** This can be international, domestic, or a road trip.
    - **Add to my calendar a reminder to plan at least one intentional 'fun night' every month with other people for movies, video games or board games.** I've always had a blast at these so I wish I did this more.
    - **Continue saying yes to more new experiences like live shows and concerts.** I love these and really should keep a tab on what's happening around me for this. Maybe I can build myself a feed?
- **Work**: This year I really want to focus on upskilling myself. I still feel like I haven't reached my potential here yet to have the luxury of being distracted by other projects.
    - **Consume more software engineering knowledge.** I still have unfinished books I'm meaning to read and mini-projects I want to build. I'll be documenting my journey on this blog so stay tuned for more.
    - **"Teach everything you know, create every day, and work in public".** This is a mantra I heard from [Nathan Barry](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/nathan-barry-interview#nathan-explains-the-three-business-philosophies-that-drive-him) that I want to embody and actually schedule in time for.
    - **Embrace the suck and continue improving at LeetCode.** This is something I don't enjoy 'needing' to do but I think is currently necessary for the level I want to reach. I had eye-opening experiences in 2023 where I found myself visibly improving (e.g. being able to solve problems that I haven't looked at for months) so I'm curious to see how far I can push it. More on this another time.
- **Habits**:
    - **Aim to accomplish something everyday, change my environment frequently and seek more novel experiences**. Life passes by extremely fast for me nowadays. I want to prevent that feeling of monotony I felt earlier in 2023 and emulate the feeling you get of time going slower when you're on a trip.
    - **Be (slightly) more ruthless with my time scheduling**. Telling myself I'll be *extremely* strict with my calendar has never worked. But the reality for me is that if it's not scheduled then I'm not doing it. I can usually accomplish a lot more than I think I can in a given period of time, except I also do procrastinate, doom-scroll my phone for too long or stretch myself too thin.
