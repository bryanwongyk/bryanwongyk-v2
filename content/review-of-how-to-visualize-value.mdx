This article would be applicable to anyone who wants to upgrade their communication in any professional or marketing setting.

In 2021, I came across this Twitter account called `@visualizevalue` that was blowing up.
The account would post minimal black-and-white images visualising a business concept, life philosophy or quote.

Looking to 'learn the secret sauce' behind the account growth, I decided to spend a few hundred dollars on the course `How to Visualize Value` (unfortunately for me, its priced far lower now in the double digits).

It piqued my interest because the person behind the account (Jack Butcher) has spent many years as a creative director in the advertising industry.
The course taught me a lot about how to use visual imagery to communicate more effectively and gave some useful design resources.

In this post I'll detail 3 of my high-level takeaways that I still carry with me to this day.

## Lesson #1: Pictures speak a thousand words, so they're more efficient than words
This applies whether you're building anything from slideshow presentations, to designing websites, or building advertising material.

For artifacts intended to convey information like slideshow presentations, imagery can help to:
- Make certain explanations clearer
- Reduce visual clutter
- Emphasise the impact of a proposal or piece of data
- Tell an overarching story throughout the presentation

For artifacts intended to capture attention like landing pages or advertising material, imagery helps to deliver the impact of the message more efficiently and effectively in a given moment. People likely only spend a few seconds maximum looking at an advertisement.

I come across this a lot even professionally as a software engineer. Diagrams are so much more effective at both capturing attention and explaining concepts than walls of text.

## Lesson #2: Use known visual patterns
Just like how a writer may use a simile, metaphor or analogy to drive a point home, a designer can do the same.

### Visual metaphors
1. __Transformations__: Visualising two things side by side as a before and after to elicit comparison. e.g. BEFORE > AFTER
2. __Sequences__: Showing sequences to visualise progression. e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3. __Recipes__: Visualise components to reach a desired outcome. e.g. A + B = C
4. __Hierarchies__: Visualise components by level of importance.

### Symbolism
We can use known symbols that people already associate with meaning.
For example:
- A 'compound interest curve' or 'hockey-stick curve' to denote exponential growth
- Dashed lines to represent motion
- Arrows to represent a journey

## Lesson #3: Be deliberate with your imagery to make the message clearer
> The goal is to make every design decision intentionally to create value

- Colours, photos and typography elicit certain moods or personas.

- Alignment and restraint make things more visually appealing _and_ clearer.

- Contrast in the design and the content (e.g. making a before and after look more extreme) strengthen the message.
